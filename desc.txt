The real story:
Xserver has two clipboards:
1. To store selection
2. For normal copy+paste
Some applications save information only in selection. Even if you select
"Copy" operation, or press Ctrl+C or Ctrl+insert.
As the result you cannot paste it to some other application normaly. 

Here comes one of the glipperus features: It saves every selection in it's menu,
and when You need it in normal clipoard you can select it from menu. 

Current clipboard entry is marked with tick mark
